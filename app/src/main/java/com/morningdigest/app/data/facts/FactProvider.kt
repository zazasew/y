/**
 * A small offline pool of one-paragraph "fact of the day" entries, grouped by
 * category. Kept fully offline (no extra API/network dependency) since the
 * fact is cosmetic and shouldn't be able to fail the digest refresh. A new
 * one is picked at random every time [buildFreshReport] runs, so it changes
 * on every manual refresh as well as on the scheduled morning run.
 *
 * Deliberately avoids the handful of facts that show up in literally every
 * "did you know" list ever printed (honey never spoiling, octopuses having
 * three hearts, a day on Venus being longer than its year, etc.) - those get
 * old fast precisely because everyone's already heard them. The pool below
 * leans toward more specific, less-recycled trivia across a wider spread of
 * categories, so repeats feel less likely and each one still lands.
